# Project Title:
Coarse-Grained Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)


# Overview:
This repository is dedicated to the event detection task, which constitutes my **Homework 1** for the course **MULTILINGUAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING**, part of my Masterâ€™s in AI and Robotics at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home). The project explores two distinct approaches to Coarse-Grained WSD:

1. **Baseline Model (Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe pre-trained embeddings):** This approach evaluates the performance of a Bidirectional LSTM model enhanced with GloVe pre-trained word embeddings, providing a foundation for understanding the baseline capabilities in coarse-grained WSD.

2. **Transformer Architecture (RoBERTa):** This method leverages the RoBERTa model, a robust transformer-based architecture, to explore advanced techniques in coarse-grained WSD and compare its performance against the baseline model.
